# Monkey-Business

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your interest in our game Monkey Business! This game was the result of the hard work of five high schoolers new to Unity and programming in C#. We had a lot of fun making it so we hope you enjoy!

*GENERAL TIPS*
1. At the start of the game, press CTRL and WASD to get unstuck. We don't know why the player gets stuck at the very beginning.
2. Test out the grapple hook in the first level! Move around while grappled onto a object to get a feel for the mechanics.
3. You can run on vertical walls when holding CTRL! 
4. Explore the whole level to find secrets.
5. Bananas and peanuts will guide you.

Thank you again for supporting us by downloading our game! As of writing this (2024) we are all in college pursuing degrees in computer science! 
Lastly, we want to apologize for the lack of music and any bugs you may encounter. This game had a very tight deadline so we used pre-existing music to finish the game. 
Sadly this had to be removed for the public release.
